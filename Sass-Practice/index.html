              It Ends with Us spoke to me on a deeply personal level: there were
              moments when I found myself putting the book down just so I could
              take a breath. This book is a highly sensitive portrayal of
              different relationships, and I think anyone with a heartbeat
              should read it. Hoover shows how the one you love the most can end
              up hurting you the most, but that just because you love someone it
              doesnâ€™t mean you should give them the power to damage you.
